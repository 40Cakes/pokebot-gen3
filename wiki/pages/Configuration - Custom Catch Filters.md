# ü•Ö Custom Catch Filters Config

[`profiles/customcatchfilters.py`](../../profiles/customcatchfilters.py)

All Pok√©mon encounters are checked by custom catch filters, use this file if you are after Pok√©mon that match very specific criteria, some examples are provided (most are disabled by default).

These filters are checked *after* the catch block list, so if Wurmple is on your [catch block list](Configuration%20-%20Catch%20Block%20List.md), the Wurmple evolution example below will still be checked.

If you are not familiar with Python, it is highly recommended to use an IDE such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/compare/?product=pycharm&product=pycharm-ce) (Community Edition) to edit this file as any syntax errors will be highlighted, and the `pokemon` object will auto-complete and show available parameters for you to filter on.

If you are familiar with Python, a comprehensive list of `pokemon` properties can be found [here](../../modules/pokemon.py).

- `return "any message"` (string) - will command the bot to catch the current encounter, the string returned will be added to the Discord webhook if `custom_filter_pokemon_encounter` is enabled in [Discord config](Configuration%20-%20Discord%20Integration.md)
- `pass` - will skip the check, and continue to check other criteria further down the file
- `save_pk3(pokemon)` instead of `return "any message"` will [dump a .pk3 file](Configuration%20-%20Logging%20and%20Console%20Output.md) and continue without pausing the bot until auto-catch is ready

The following example will catch any shiny Wurmple that will evolve into Silcoon/Beautifly, and ignore any that would evolve into Cascoon/Dustox:

```py
# Shiny Wurmple evolving based on evolution
if pokemon.is_shiny and pokemon.species.name == "Wurmple":
    if pokemon.wurmple_evolution == "silcoon":
        return "Shiny Wurmple evolving into Silcoon/Beautifly"
    if pokemon.wurmple_evolution == "cascoon":
        pass
```

This example will catch any shiny Unown letters, add the Unown letters you need to the list `["A", "B", "C"]`:

```py
if pokemon.is_shiny and pokemon.species.name == "Unown" and pokemon.unown_letter in ["A", "B", "C"]:
    return f"Shiny {pokemon.unown_letter} Unown"
```

The following example will catch any Pok√©mon with all perfect IVs:
```py
# Pok√©mon with perfect IVs
if pokemon.ivs.sum() == (6 * 31):
    return "Pok√©mon with perfect IVs"
```

- **Note**: for technical reasons, you **must** restart the bot after editing this file for changes to take effect! Reloading config with `Ctrl + C` will not work for `py` files.
