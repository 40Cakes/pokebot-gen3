# ‚ùå Catch Block List Config

[`profiles/catch_block.yml`](../../profiles/catch_block.yml.dist)

The catch block list is a list of shinies to skip, useful if you don't want to fill up your PC with very common shiny encounters.

### Notes

- Phase stats will still be reset after encountering a shiny on the block list.
- The block list is automatically reloaded by the bot during a shiny encounter, so you can modify this file while the bot is running!
- To add Nidoran Male/Female, use `Nidoran‚ôÄ` or `Nidoran‚ôÇ` respectively
- Unown forms can be added by inserting the character in parenthesis e.g. `Unown (F)` or `Unown (?)`, but you can also just use `Unown` to block all of them

`block_list` - list of Pok√©mon to skip catching (one per line), example:

```
block_list:
  - Poochyena
  - Pidgey
  - Rattata
  - Nidoran‚ôÄ
  - Unown (F)
```
