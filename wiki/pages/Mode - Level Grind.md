# 🔄️ Level Grind Mode

This mode will continuously fight battles in order to level up your Pokémon.

When starting the mode, you have a choice between only levelling up your current lead
Pokémon, or levelling your entire team. In the latter case, the mode will always use
the lowest-level Pokémon to battle and rotate them as necessary.

When the active Pokémon is defeated or gets low on HP, it will heal at the nearest
Pokémon Center automatically. Likewise, if your entire party gets defeated it will
just return to the Tall Grass spot you've picked. So this mode should be pretty much
hands-off.

Should this mode encounter a Shiny or a Pokémon that matches your custom catch filters,
it will **not** battle it but instead either catch it automatically (if auto-catching is
enabled in your configuration) or put the bot back into manual mode. So you don't have to
worry about missing out on a Shiny.


## Instructions

Start this mode while standing somewhere in tall grass that has a _direct_ overworld
connection to a Pokémon Center (i.e. it must be possible to walk to the PC without
going through any buildings.)

If the mode is not available for selection, that means that this route is not supported.
Try another route that has an easy overland path to a Pokémon Center.
