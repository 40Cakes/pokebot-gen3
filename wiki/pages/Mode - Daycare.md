## Requirements

- A compatible breeding couple in the Daycare

### Optional, but recommended
- (Emerald only) Having a Pokémon with [Flame Body](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Flame_Body_(Ability)) or [Magma Armor](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Magma_Armor_(Ability)) ability in your
  party (even if it's fained) halves the number of steps required. 
- [Mach Bike](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mach_Bike) (R/S/E) or [Bicycle](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bicycle) (FR/LG) registered to `Select` will help getting
  those steps in quicker.

## Instructions

Start this mode while being on Route 117 (in R/S/E) or Sevii Island Four (FR/LG), the bot will
collect up to five eggs, and once all have hatched, release them in the Daycare PC if they're
not Shiny.
