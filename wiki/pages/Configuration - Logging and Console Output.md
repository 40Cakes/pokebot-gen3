# üìÑ Logging and Console Output Config

[`profiles/logging.yml`](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/blob/main/profiles/logging.yml)

This file allows you to control logging certain data to files and the output of the terminal window.

## Logging
### Options
`log_encounters` - log all encounters to .csv (`stats/encounters/` folder), each phase is logged to a separate file

### Console output
Console options will control how much data is displayed in the Python terminal/console, valid options are `verbose`, `basic` or `disable`.

`console`:
- `encounter_data`
- `encounter_ivs`
- `encounter_moves`
- `statistics`

## Save raw Pok√©mon data (.pk3)
The bot can dump individual Pok√©mon files (.pk3 format) to be managed/transferred in the [PKHeX save editor](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX).

The Pok√©mon are dumped to the `pokemon/` folder in your profile, in the following format:

`273 ‚òÖ - SEEDOT - Modest [180] - C88CF14B19C6.pk3` (`<nat_dex_num> <shiny ‚òÖ> - <mon_name> - <nature> [<IV sum>] - <pid>.pk3`)

### Options
`save_pk3`:
- `all` - dump all encounters
- `shiny` - dump shiny encounters
- `custom` - dump custom catch filter encounters

Feel free to share any rare/interesting .pk3 files in [#pkhexchangeüí±](https://discord.com/channels/1057088810950860850/1123523909745135616)!

## Automatically add Pok√©mon to PC storage (.pk3)
While auto-catch is currently still a work in progress, the following option will automatically import encountered Pok√©mon into your PC storage.

Imported Pok√©mon will be placed into the first available PC slot, in a regular Pok√©Ball.

If space is available in the PC, and the Pok√©mon was successfully imported, the bot will run from the encounter and continue to hunt.

### Options
`import_pk3` - enable automatic .pk3 import to PC storage
