# 🏃 Roamer Re-Encounter Mode
This mode helps with encountering a Roaming Pokémon again after it has fled a battle.

It will run around the map (using Repel to avoid any other encounters) until it
encounters the Roamer, in which case it switches back to manual mode.

## Requirements for Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald
