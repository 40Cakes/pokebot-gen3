# 🎲 Random Inputs Mode

⚠️ Warning: proceed with caution as anything is possible with this mode such as selling items or releasing your Pokémon from the PC!

This mode simply presses 1 "random" button every 5 frames. Each button has an arbitrary weighting which can be edited [here](../../modules/modes/random.py), this is done to reduce the likelihood of `Start` and `Select` being spammed (seizure inducing).

Any of the following GBA buttons can be pressed:

`A`, `B`, `Start`, `Select`, `Right`, `Left`, `Up`, `Down`

The following GBA buttons cannot be pressed:

`L`, `R`, `Power`, `Reset`
