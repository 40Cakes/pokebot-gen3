# 🏃 Roamer Reset Mode
Roamer reset mode helps with finding shiny roaming Pokémon via soft-resetting.

## Emerald

On Emerald, this mode needs some preparation **before defeating the Elite Four for the first time!**

- Make sure you have a Pokémon that knows **Fly** in your party
- Make sure you have a Pokémon **between level 14 and 40** in your party (in order for Repel to work properly)
   - If this Pokémon has the ability **Illuminate** or **Arena Trap**, it will speed up the hunt by about 18%. But this is not strictly necessary
- Make your you have some **repels** in your inventory. The mode will soft reset when it runs out of repels, but that makes it less efficient
   - To all but ensure you never run out of them, make sure to pack at least **40 Max Repels**, or **50 Super Repels**, or **100 Repels**, or a combination thereof
- After defeating the Elite Four for the first time, you will be sent back to your house in Littleroot Town. **Do not leave the upper floor of that house or you will not be able to use this mode with that save game!**
- Move a Pokémon between level 14 and 40 (see step 2) to the front of your party
- Save the game (**in-game, not a save state**)
- Start mode


## FireRed/LeafGreen

   - If this Pokémon has the ability **Illuminate** or **Arena Trap**, it will speed up the hunt by about 18%, but this is not strictly necessary
   - Move that Pokémon **to the front of your party**
- Make your you have some **repels** in your inventory
  - The mode will soft reset when it runs out of repels, but that makes it less efficient 
  - To all but ensure you never run out of them, make sure to pack at least **40 Max Repels**, or **50 Super Repels**, or **100 Repels**, or a combination thereof
