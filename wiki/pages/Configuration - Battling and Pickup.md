# ‚öî Battling and Pickup Config

[`profiles/battle.yml`](../../modules/config/templates/battle.yml)

The bot can automatically battle Pok√©mon that don't meet any catch criteria.

## Auto Catching

`auto_catch` - enable automatic catching of encounters-of-interest (shinies and those that match your custom catch filters.)

If your lead Pok√©mon knows False Swipe, the bot may use that. It will also try to use sleep-inducing or paralysing moves
where it makes sense.

Other than that, it will just throw Pok√© balls at the opponent. It chooses the most effective ball from the inventory
(but will never use Master balls.)

## Pickup

> **Please be aware that Pickup has only been tested in Emerald, and may not work in other games.**

`pickup` - enable pickup farming, the bot will use [Pickup (ability)](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pickup_(Ability)>) to items from Pok√©mon who have picked up items. See [Pickup items](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pickup_(Ability)#Items_received>).

`pickup_threshold` - number of Pok√©mon in the party that should have an item before the bot tries to take items from them. If you have fewer Pok√©mon with Pickup in your party than this number, the bot will use that number instead.

`pickup_check_frequency` - wait interval encounters to get before checking for pickup items.

- If `faster_pickup` is enabled in [üíé Cheats](Configuration%20-%20Cheats.md), this threshold is ignored.

## Battling

`hp_threshold` - Minimum HP percentage for a Pok√©mon to be considered fit for battle.

`lead_cannot_battle_action` - What to do if the lead Pok√©mon is not fit to fight after a battle (fainted or HP below the threshold)

- `stop` - go into manual mode
- `flee` - run from the encounter
- `rotate` - send out the next Pok√©mon in the party (must have at least {hp_threshold}% of its health and at least 1 usable move)

`faint_action` - What to do if a Pok√©mon faints during a battle.

- `stop` - go into manual mode
- `flee` - run from the encounter (will go to manual mode if it's a trainer battle)
- `rotate` - send out the next Pok√©mon in the party (must have at least {hp_threshold}% of its health and at least 1 usable move)

`new_move` - how to behave if a Pok√©mon attempts to learn a new move.

- `stop` - go into manual mode
- `cancel` - stop the Pok√©mon from learning a new move
- `learn_best`- calculate the weakest move from the Pok√©mon's current move set. If the new move is better, replaces that move with the new move. If the Pok√©mon knows more than one move of a certain type, the bot will attempt to delete the weakest move with redundant typing in order to maximize coverage

`stop_evolution` - Set to `true` to prevent Pok√©mon from evolving during/after a battle (evolution will be cancelled by pressing `B`), or `false` to allow it.

`switch_strategy` - Either `first_available` to switch to the next Pok√©mon in the list or `lowest_level` to try and level up lower Pok√©mon

`lead_mon_balance_levels` - `false` or `true` - `true` will switch your lead Pok√©mon out when it levels above another member of your team. Currently only works with Pok√©center Loop mode.

`banned_moves` - list of moves for the battle engine to never select. Moves that are banned will not be selected in combat.

`avoided_pokemon` - list of Pok√©mon for the battle engine to never fight. Pok√©mon that are avoided will be fled from.

`targeted_pokemon` - list of Pok√©mon for the battle engine to fight. Pok√©mon that are not targeted will be fled from.
