# ‚öî Battling and Pickup Config

[`profiles/battle.yml`](../../profiles/battle.yml)

The bot can automatically battle Pok√©mon that don't meet any catch criteria.

## Pickup
`pickup` - enable pickup farming, the bot will use [Pickup (ability)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pickup_(Ability)) to items from Pok√©mon who have picked up items. See [Pickup items](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pickup_(Ability)#Items_received).

`pickup_threshold` - number of Pok√©mon in the party that should have an item before the bot tries to take items from them. If you have fewer Pok√©mon with Pickup in your party than this number, the bot will use that number instead.

`pickup_check_frequency` - wait interval encounters to get before checking for pickup items.
- If `faster_pickup` is enabled in [üíé Cheats](Configuration%20-%20Cheats.md), this threshold is ignored.

## Battling
`battle` - enable battling opponents

`battle_method` - placeholder for an intelligent battle engine in the future.

`faint_action` - how to behave if lead Pok√©mon faints. 
- `stop` - go into manual mode
- `flee` - run from the encounter
- `rotate` - send out the next Pok√©mon in the party (must have at least 20% of its health and at least 1 usable move)

`new_move` - how to behave if a Pok√©mon attempts to learn a new move.
- `stop` - go into manual mode
- `cancel` - stop the Pok√©mon from learning a new move
- `learn_best`- calculate the weakest move from the Pok√©mon's current move set. If the new move is better, replaces that move with the new move. If the Pok√©mon knows more than one move of a certain type, the bot will attempt to delete the weakest move with redundant typing in order to maximize coverage

`stop_evolution` - prevent Pok√©mon from evolving

`replace_lead_battler` - switch the order of Pok√©mon in the party to replace a lead Pok√©mon that runs out of PP or runs low on HP. Helpful for leveling the whole team.

`switch_strategy` - Placeholder for future functionality for more intelligent switching in battle.

`banned_moves` - list of moves for the battle engine to never select. Moves that are banned will not be selected in combat.
