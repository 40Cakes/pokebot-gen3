# 🔄 Spin Mode

Spins clockwise on a single tile as fast as possible, useful for Safari Zone and [repel tricking](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Repel_trick) as it doesn't count steps.

Start the mode while in the overworld, in any patch of grass/water/cave with encounters.

## Safari Zone

### Ruby / Sapphire / Emerald
> **Note:** The Safari Zone catch strategy is **not implemented** for these games.

### Fire Red / Leaf Green

The `auto_catch` Safari strategy for `Fire Red` and `Leaf Green` is designed using an in-depth
[study](https://www.docdroid.net/Tx5NbeU/safari-zone-research-pdf),
which calculate the most effective sequence for catching a Pokémon based on both the Pokémon encountered and 
the number of Safari Balls remaining at the start of the encounter.

The bot uses optimal catch patterns, which are available in these 
[lookup tables](https://www.docdroid.net/g3I5Qtl/frlg-lookup-tables-pdf), to maximize catch rates for each Pokémon.

### Note
Since a high number of Safari Balls is essential for shiny hunting, the bot will automatically switch to manual mode 
if your Safari Ball count drops below `15`.
