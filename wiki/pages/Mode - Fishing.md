Fishing is a way to use a fishing rod to catch wild Pokémon in the water. Some Pokémon can only be caught by using a fishing rod.

- (Recommended) The first Pokémon in the party (can be fainted) should have the ability [Sticky Hold](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sticky_Hold_(Ability)) or [Suction Cups](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Suction_Cups_(Ability)) to increase the bite rate while fishing
- Register any fishing rod and start the mode while facing water

## Safari Zone

### Ruby / Sapphire / Emerald
> **Note:** The Safari Zone catch strategy is **not implemented** for these games.

### Fire Red / Leaf Green

The `auto_catch` Safari strategy for `Fire Red` and `Leaf Green` is designed using an in-depth
[study](https://www.docdroid.net/Tx5NbeU/safari-zone-research-pdf),
which calculate the most effective sequence for catching a Pokémon based on both the Pokémon encountered and
the number of Safari Balls remaining at the start of the encounter.

The bot uses optimal catch patterns, which are available in these
[lookup tables](https://www.docdroid.net/g3I5Qtl/frlg-lookup-tables-pdf), to maximize catch rates for each Pokémon.

### Note
Since a high number of Safari Balls is essential for shiny hunting, the bot will automatically switch to manual mode
if your Safari Ball count drops below `15`.
