Fishing is a way to use a fishing rod to catch wild Pokémon in the water. Some Pokémon can only be caught by using a fishing rod.

- (Recommended) The first Pokémon in the party (can be fainted) should have the ability [Sticky Hold](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sticky_Hold_(Ability)) or [Suction Cups](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Suction_Cups_(Ability)) to increase the bite rate while fishing
- Register any fishing rod and start the mode while facing water
