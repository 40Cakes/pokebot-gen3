# General Tips & Tricks

The following tips are generally applicable to most shiny hunts, an enormous amount of time will be saved over a long period hunting:

- Set in-game **TEXT SPEED** to **FAST**
- Set in-game **BATTLE SCENE** to **OFF**
- Utilise [repel tricks](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Repel_trick) to boost encounter rates of target Pok√©mon
- Using modes [Spin](Mode%20-%20Spin.md) or [Bunny Hop](Mode%20-%20Acro%20Bike%20Bunny%20Hop.md), repels will become effectively infinite + steps won't be counted in Safari Zone
- Use a lead Pok√©mon with encounter rate boosting [abilities](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Abilities_that_affect_appearance_of_wild_Pok%C3%A9mon), such as **[Illuminate](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Illuminate_(Ability))**
- Use a lead Pok√©mon with a [short cry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rmtNdlIXiif1Sz20i-9mfhFdoqb1VnAOIntlr3tnPeU)
- Use a lead Pok√©mon with a single character nickname
- Don't use a shiny lead Pok√©mon (shiny animations take a few frames at the start of every battle)
- Minimise the usage of lead Pok√©mon in a [Smoke Ball](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Smoke_Ball), or with an ability such as [Run Away](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Run_Away_(Ability)) while not repel tricking, as these will add additional text at the end of every encounter
