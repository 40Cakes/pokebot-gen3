## Safari Zone

The mode will continuously try to enter the Safari Zone, so make sure you have some cash. The bot will use up to ₽25,000 and then soft reset to start over. If you have less cash than that, it will soft-reset when money runs out.

- Go to the _entrance_ of the Safari Zone (see image below)
- Make sure you have some cash on you
- Save the game (**in-game, not a save state**)
- Start mode
