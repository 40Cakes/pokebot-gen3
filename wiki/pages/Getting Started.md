- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - recommended for syntax highlighting while editing `.yml` config files

### Use a `venv` (optional)
<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>
If you're using Python for any other projects, it is **highly recommended** to use a virtual environment (`venv`) to isolate these packages from your base environment.

Once Python is installed, set up a `venv`, open a shell in the bot directory and enter the following command:

`python -m venv .`

A `venv` may be ‚Äúactivated‚Äù using a script in its binary directory (`bin` on POSIX; `Scripts` on Windows). This will prepend that directory to your PATH, so that running python will invoke the environment‚Äôs Python interpreter and you can run installed scripts without having to use their full path. The invocation of the activation script is platform-specific (`<venv>` must be replaced by the path to the directory containing the virtual environment):

| Platform | Shell                                         | Command to activate virtual environment                                                                                                       |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POSIX    | bash/zsh<br/>fish<br/>csh/tcsh<br/>PowerShell | `$ source <venv>/bin/activate`<br/>`$ source <venv>/bin/activate.fish`<br/>`$ source <venv>/bin/activate.csh`<br/>`$ <venv>/bin/Activate.ps1` |
| Windows  | cmd.exe<br/>PowerShell                        | `C:\> <venv>\Scripts\activate.bat`<br/>`PS C:\> <venv>\Scripts\Activate.ps1`                                                                  |

Once activated, run the bot (your shell should show `(venv)` if activated correctly):

`(venv)$ python ./pokebot.py` (POSIX)

`(venv) PS C:\> python ./pokebot.py` (Windows)

</details>

## Run the Bot
- Place some **official** Pok√©mon .gba ROMs into the `./roms/` folder
- Double click `pokebot.py` or run `python pokebot.py` in a terminal and follow the on-screen steps to create and/or select a profile

The bot ships with the default mGBA input mapping, see [here](../../profiles/keys.yml.dist) for the default mapping, or customise them to your preference.

You **must** ensure you are able to escape battle **100% of the time**, otherwise the bot will get stuck.
If you have a save from mGBA that you'd like to import and use with the bot, then you will need to import the save state.

This bot is still in development, as such, functionality is subject to change - always make sure you back up your `./profiles/` folder before updating your bot! 

## Import a Save
- In mGBA (standalone), run a game and load into the save file
- **File** > **Save State File...** > **Save**
- Double click `pokebot.py` or run `python pokebot.py` in a terminal > type a profile **name** > click **Load Existing Save**
- Open the save state file you just saved
- A new bot profile will be created in the `./profiles/` folder, and launched

## Tips/Tricks
- Set in-game **TEXT SPEED** to **FAST**
- Set in-game **BATTLE SCENE** to **OFF**
- Utilise [repel tricks](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Repel_trick) to boost encounter rates of target Pok√©mon
- Using modes [Spin](Mode%20-%20Spin.md) or [Bunny Hop](Mode%20-%20Acro%20Bike%20Bunny%20Hop.md), repels will become effectively infinite + steps won't be counted in Safari Zone
- Use a lead Pok√©mon with encounter rate boosting [abilities](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Abilities_that_affect_appearance_of_wild_Pok%C3%A9mon), such as **[Illuminate](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Illuminate_(Ability))**
- Use a lead Pok√©mon with a [short cry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rmtNdlIXiif1Sz20i-9mfhFdoqb1VnAOIntlr3tnPeU)
- Use a lead Pok√©mon with a single character nickname
- Don't use a shiny lead Pok√©mon (shiny animation takes a few frames at the start of every battle)

## Debugging (advanced)
<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

The bot supports auto-starting a profile and can also be launched into a "debug" mode which will open an extra pane next to the emulator to aid bot development.

The debug tabs includes information such as currently running game tasks and callbacks, emulator inputs, as well as information about recent battles, player status, current map, daycare and event flags.

```
positional arguments:
  profile               Profile to initialize. Otherwise, the profile selection menu will appear.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m {MODE_NAME}, --bot-mode {MODE_NAME}
                        Initial bot mode (default: Manual)
  -s {0,1,2,3,4,8,16,32}, --emulation-speed {0,1,2,3,4,8,16,32}
                        Initial emulation speed (0 for unthrottled; default: 1)
  -nv, --no-video       Turn off video output by default
  -na, --no-audio       Turn off audio output by default
  -t, --always-on-top   Keep the bot window always on top of other windows
  -d, --debug           Enable extra debug options and a debug menu
```

Use environment variable `POKEBOT_UNTHEMED=1` with debug mode as `ttkthemes` causes major lag with complex UIs.
