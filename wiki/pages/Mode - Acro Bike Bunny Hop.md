Bunny hop on the spot with the [Acro Bike](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Acro_Bike), useful for Safari Zone and [repel tricking](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Repel_trick) as it doesn't count steps.

Register the Acro Bike and start the mode while in the overworld, in any patch of grass/cave with encounters.

**Note**: Bunny hopping is slower encounters/h on average when compared to [spin](Mode%20-%20Spin.md) mode.
