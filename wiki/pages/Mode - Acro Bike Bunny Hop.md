Bunny hop on the spot with the [Acro Bike](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Acro_Bike), useful for Safari Zone and [repel tricking](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Repel_trick) as it doesn't count steps.

Register the Acro Bike and start the mode while in the overworld, in any patch of grass/cave with encounters.

**Note**: Bunny hopping is slower encounters/h on average when compared to [spin](Mode%20-%20Spin.md) mode.

## Safari Zone

### Ruby / Sapphire / Emerald
The `auto_catch` Safari strategy for `Ruby` / `Sapphire` / `Emerald` is designed using an in-depth
[study](https://www.docdroid.net/oiHhrwd/hoenn-safari-zone-research-pdf), which calculate the most effective Pokéblock and Safari ball sequence for catching a Pokémon based on the Pokémon encountered.
The bot will use your Pokéblock case if you have some available to perform the strategy, or throw balls until the target is captured.
