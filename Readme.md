**Pok√©Bot Gen3 (libmgba)** is a bot, written in Python that automatically shiny hunts in Pok√©mon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed and LeafGreen.

Initially created to complete a Prof. Oak and Living ‚ú®Shiny‚ú® Dex Challenge in Pok√©mon Emerald, a üî¥24/7 livestream of the challenge can be found ongoing [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6OOnrx8g58).

# üìñ Preamble
- This is still in development, as such, functionality is subject to change - always make sure you back up your `profiles` folders before updating your bot!
- Reach out in Discord [#bot-support-libmgba‚ùî](https://discord.com/channels/1057088810950860850/1139190426834833528) if you have any issues

The bot is frame perfect and can _technically_ cheat by reading data from any point in memory. By default it will attempt to perform actions as if a human were playing to make gameplay as representative as possible, some examples:
- Starter Pok√©mon are generated just _1 frame_ after confirming the starter selection, the bot will wait until the battle begins, and the starter Pok√©mon sprite is visible before resetting
- It's possible to peek inside un-hatched eggs to view stats and shininess as soon as they're received from the daycare, the bot will wait until the eggs are fully hatched before checking and logging
- These are intentional design decisions, bot [cheats](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki/%F0%9F%92%8E-Cheats) can be used to bypass them (in most cases)

# ‚ùì Getting Started
Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki) for information on running the bot.

The wiki contains information about the default emulator keybinds/inputs, bot modes, configuration files and more (use the side bar to navigate)!

# ‚è© Tips/Tricks
## Optimal game settings

- Set **TEXT SPEED** to **FAST**
- Set **BATTLE SCENE** to **OFF**
- Utilise [repel tricks](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Repel_trick) to boost encounter rates of target Pok√©mon
- Using modes [Spin](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki/%F0%9F%94%84-Spin) or [Bunny Hop](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki/%F0%9F%9A%B2-Bunny-Hop) and repels will become effectively infinite + steps won't be counted in Safari Zone
- Use a lead Pok√©mon with encounter rate boosting [abilities](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Abilities_that_affect_appearance_of_wild_Pok%C3%A9mon), such as **[Illuminate](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Illuminate_(Ability))**
- Use a lead Pok√©mon with a [short cry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rmtNdlIXiif1Sz20i-9mfhFdoqb1VnAOIntlr3tnPeU)
- Use a lead Pok√©mon with a single character nickname
- Don't use a shiny lead Pok√©mon (shiny animation takes a few frames at the start of every battle)

                        Initial bot mode (default: Manual)
  -s {0,1,2,3,4}, --emulation-speed {0,1,2,3,4}
                        Initial emulation speed (0 for unthrottled; default: 1)
  -nv, --no-video       Turn off video output by default
  -na, --no-audio       Turn off audio output by default
