**Pok√©Bot Gen3 (libmgba)** is a bot, written in Python that automatically shiny hunts in Pok√©mon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed and LeafGreen.

Initially created to complete a Prof. Oak and Living ‚ú®Shiny‚ú® Dex Challenge in Pok√©mon Emerald, a üî¥24/7 livestream of the challenge can be found ongoing [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6OOnrx8g58).

# ‚ú® Preamble
This bot is still in development, as such, functionality is subject to change - always make sure you back up your `profiles` folders before updating your bot! 

The bot is frame perfect and can _technically_ cheat by reading data from any point in memory and manipulating RNG. By default it will attempt to perform actions as if a human were playing to make gameplay as representative as possible, some examples:
- Starter Pok√©mon are generated just _1 frame_ after confirming the starter selection, the bot will wait until the battle begins, and the starter Pok√©mon sprite is visible before resetting
- It's possible to peek inside un-hatched eggs to view stats and shininess as soon as they're received from the daycare, the bot will wait until the eggs are fully hatched before checking and logging
- Feebas tile locations could be instantly located by reading memory, the bot will attempt to locate the tiles by searching each tile individually

These are intentional design decisions, bot [cheats](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki/%F0%9F%92%8E-Cheats) can be used to bypass them (in most cases).

# ‚ö† Photosensitivity Warning
- Running mGBA at unbound speeds (3,000+ frames per second on high-end PCs), can cause **very fast and bright flashing**!
- Any unbounded video examples on the wiki will be hidden by default, and marked with **‚ö† photosensitivity warning**

# ‚ùì Getting Started
Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3/wiki) for information getting started, keybinds/inputs, bot modes, configuration files and more!

# üêõ Debugging

The bot supports auto-starting a profile and can also be launched into a "debug" mode which will open an extra pane next to the emulator to aid bot development.

The debug tabs includes information such as currently running game tasks and callbacks, emulator inputs, as well as information about recent battles, player status, current map, daycare and event flags.

```
positional arguments:
  profile               Profile to initialize. Otherwise, the profile selection menu will appear.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m {MODE_NAME}, --bot-mode {MODE_NAME}
                        Initial bot mode (default: Manual)
  -s {0,1,2,3,4}, --emulation-speed {0,1,2,3,4}
                        Initial emulation speed (0 for unthrottled; default: 1)
  -nv, --no-video       Turn off video output by default
  -na, --no-audio       Turn off audio output by default
  -t, --always-on-top   Keep the bot window always on top of other windows
  -d, --debug           Enable extra debug options and a debug menu
```
